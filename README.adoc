= IPyIDA

IPyIDA is a python-only solution to use a IPython console in the context of IDA
Pro. It spawns an IPython kernel that you can connect to with `ipython console
--existing` in your shell or by opening a _QT Console_ window in IDA Pro with
`<Shift-.>`. You can then benefit from IPython's autocompletion, online help,
monospaced font input field, graphs, and so on.

== Install

IPyIDA has been tested with IDA 6.6 and up on Windows, OS X and Linux.

=== Fast and easy install

A script is provided to install IPyIDA and its dependencies automagically from
the IDA console. Simply copy the following line to the IDA console.

[source,python]
----
import urllib2; exec urllib2.urlopen('https://github.com/eset/ipyida/raw/stable/install_from_ida.py').read()
----

The script will do the following:

1. Install `pip` if it's not already install
2. Install the ipyida package from the `stable` branch
3. Load the ipyida plugin
4. Add a few lines to your `idapythonrc.py` so it's loaded at the proper time
   when IDA starts.

You can inspect the link:install_from_ida.py[] script if you wish to see
exactly what it does.

WARNING: Don't panic. It's normal to see Windows' command prompt window open
         during the installation on Windows.

==== Upgrading

Rerun the install script to update to the latest version and restart IDA.

=== Install it the IDA way

This is *not* the recommend way of installing IPyIDA but if you insist, you can
copy the `ipyida_plugin_stub.py` and the `ipyida` directory inside IDA's
`plugins` directory.

This method requires that you manage dependencies on your own. IPyIDA requires
the `ipykernel` and `qtconsole` package.

== Caveats

=== Notebook not working

IPython notebook cannot attach to an existing kernel like `ipython console` and
`ipython qtconsole` do. There's some more background info here:
https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/4066.

There are workarounds to this be I didn't include one yet. I will consider
adding it if it's not too hackish. Pull requests are welcome.

=== External console not responding if IDA's window is in the background for too long

This problem is specific to OS X's App Nap feature in OS X 10.9 and up. When
running  Disabling App Nap for IDA Pro seems to fix the problem, but is a a hack
for now and will use more battery on a laptop, we should find a better solution.

Here is how to disable App Nap for IDA Pro:

[source,bash]
----
defaults write com.hexrays.idaq   NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES
defaults write com.hexrays.idaq64 NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES
----

== Similar work

@james91b also successfully integrated a IPython kernel in IDA. Being a
non-Windows IDA user, I needed something cross-platform and took a Python-only
approach to implement it. Although the some of the implementation idea comes
from that project, IPyIDA was written from scratch. Hat tip to @james91b and all
IDA_IPython contributors. IDA_IPython is available on Github at
https://github.com/james91b/ida_ipython.

== Known Issues
If you get this error message on Windows OS
----
urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 1] _ssl.c:507: error:1407742E:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert protocol version>
----

Is related to get PIP to fix: download manually https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and save on IDA default python directory C:\Python27 and execute it.
----
cd C:\Python27
python.exe get-pip.py
----

Back to IDA console and try again:
[source,python]
----
import urllib2; exec urllib2.urlopen('https://github.com/eset/ipyida/raw/stable/install_from_ida.py').read()
